It is possible to use the release/beta version of this module and use it for filming, publicity, etc.. But it is necessary to indicate the source and its author (if the place of submission does not have the author's SNS account you can use gamebanana's account, otherwise use the account in SNS).
It can be used for secondary creation (source and author must be indicated).
It is not allowed to use it for profit.
